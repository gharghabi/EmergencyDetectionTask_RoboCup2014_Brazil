#  Emergency situation: home accident_RoboCup2014_Brazil

The robot has to properly react to an emergency situation in the house. The main story of this
test is: The house is owned by an elderly person who is currently alone at home. Unfortunately,
the person has an accident and requires immediate help. The robot detects the emergency, e.g.,
by hearing/seeing the person fall over, or perceiving the person attracting attention through
waving/calling. The robot moves to the person to learn more about the situation. It notifies an
ambulance and continues with first aid activities. It also has to carry all of this out as fast as
possible.
The test focuses on automatic detection of events related to safety, security, and human-robot
interaction in order to improve safety and security in the house in case of emergencies. Implementation of a complex behavior containing several possible cases, in an efficient way, is a
requirement to solve this task.
For this project I have used OpenNI tracker to detect person and and detectig person falling.
I have provided a system to automatically sent a text to the emergency contact.
